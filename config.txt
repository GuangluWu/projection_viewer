[Basic]

extended_xyz_file=test.xyz
# path to extended xyz file containing embedding coordinates and properties (molecular or atomic)

height_graph=530
# adjust this if your screen is too large or small

mode=compound
# can be "compound" for e.g. molecule or lattice embedding or "atomic" for atomic embedding

title=Water-MD example 
# title for the plot

soap_cutoff_radius=1.5
# the cutoff_radius you used in the construction of the SOAP-vector
# this is only important if you are in mode=atomic and you want the
# realistic size of your atomic environment to be shown, if you 
# do not need this feature, just set it to 2.5 and you'll get a nice marker anyways.

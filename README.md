 - dash_bio (You need to install a modified version from https://github.com/chkunkel/dash-bio, contact us!)
 - pandas
 - ASAP (https://github.com/BingqingCheng/ASAP, Ask BingqingCheng)
 - ASE (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)

#### Todo:

- Max, min range for colormap, colormap chooser
- Max, min range for size, maybe a size-map, should show which size belongs to which property
- So far, every field is treatd as continous. It would be good to have a detection, whether a property is categorical,
  for example if there are less than 10 values possible. Then, the colorbar and sizes should map that also.
- Improve Design, some more eyecandy should be added!
- Possibility to switch to a 3D scatter plot
